A game to help girls learn to code
<br/>Play it at http://www.playcodestitch.com 

<p>Note: this is a Rails application, so there is a big framework of files that can be tricky for those unfamiliar with Rails. I kept things concise and ugly, however, so you will conveniently find virtually all the javascript logic in app/views/welcome/index.html.erb - until I clean it up and pull the code into some cleverly named app/assets/javascripts files.
